For example, for a classification problem, we can have an ensemble of three classifiers, where the first of them is a Naive Bayes classifier, the second one is a logistic regressor and the third one is a decision tree classifier. We can train all classifiers with the same training data and then, at test time, predictions can be done using majority voting. \n",

For classification, the prediction is done by majority voting among the individual trees. For regression, the prediction is the average of the individual predictions of each tree.
